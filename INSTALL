Unpack the tarball into samba/examples/VFS  If you unpack somewhere else,
you will need to edit the Makefile.

Use the file databasefs.sql to create the two tables in your database
necessary for DatabaseFS

Run make

Create the appropriate share definition in your smb.conf.  For example:
[DatabaseFS]
   comment = DatabaseFS Virtual FS
   browseable = yes
   read only = no
   vfs objects = databasefs:jukebox
   jukebox: config_file = /path/to/config/file.conf

Reload smbd

Cross your fingers, then point your SMB client at the share.  Check logs
for errors.
